Welcome to the Coffee Vending Machine project! This is a fun, interactive Python program that simulates a coffee machine where you can choose your favorite beverages and get a virtual cup of coffee.
The project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, and functions.

Features:

Coffee Selection: Choose from a variety of coffee beverages such as Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte, Mocha, and more.
Price Calculation: Each coffee has a set price, and the total amount is calculated based on the user's order.
Add-Ons: Customize your coffee with milk, syrups, and more.
Drink Customization: Adjust the size or sweetness of your beverage (if implemented).
Error Handling: If you make a wrong selection or input, the program provides helpful error messages.
